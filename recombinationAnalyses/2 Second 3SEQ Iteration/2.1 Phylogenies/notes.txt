Region A
--------
1. In A1, the RaTG-Wuhan lineage clusters with the bat viruses and not the pangolin 
	viruses (bootstrap=86); should exclude Region A1

2. In A2, seq DQ412042 should be removed
3. In A2, CoV*45/21 should both be removed
4. Bulgaria sequence should be removed
5. A4 should be removed bc guangdong pangolin clusters outside SARS2-RaTG *and* SARS2 does not
	cluster with the five Guangxi pangolins


A1 is 3872-4716 nt positions of A
A4 is 1642-2113 nt positions of A

Call A-prime the regions with A1 and A4 removed.

REM: region A is 13291-19628


Region B
--------
no need to exclude SC2018 or CoV*21/45 from Region B specifically, but in 
general, these need to be excluded

In general, Region B is clonal as is, by itself (i.e. no PI-signals within it)


Region C
--------

Remove bulgaria sequence.  Otherwise, Region C can be presented as clonal as is.


Regions B and C together
------------------------
In region B, pink and turquoise cluster w each other (bs=78) and in region C pink and blue cluster together (bs=91).  But the bs is not over 80 for both, so we don't consider it a PI-signal.

You have to remove SC2018 from here since it has a pronounced jump (bs=90,bs=100).

You don't need to remove Cov*21|45 here.
